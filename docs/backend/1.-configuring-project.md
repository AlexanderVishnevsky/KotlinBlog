# 1. Configuring project

Let's get started. We will use the spring boot as an engine for our application because it's easy to configure, and many Java developers probably worked with it. As an alternative, you can use [Ktor](https://ktor.io/), but it seemed to me more difficult to start.

1. Go to the  [**Spring Initializr**](https://start.spring.io/) ****website and configure the project.
2. Choose Gradle project.
3. Choose Kotlin language.
4. Enter **kb** in Artifact field.
5. Add **Web**, **JPA**, **MySQL** and **Security** dependencies from the Dependencies section.
6. Click Generate Project to generate and download the project.
